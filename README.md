# parkingbnb

## This is our project created during 2017 defhacks() @ microsoft campus
Have you ever have a difficult time finding parking spot in downtown?
In average you waste around 30 minutes if you are trying to eat in jade garden on a sunday after church
no one wants that right?

so we came with a solution: parkingnb where you can find parking easily without the hustle
and if you have a parking spot nearby? you can earn a quick bucks with it!
